Adobe XD helps designers and their teams to create and collaborate on user experience designs. Major use cases for Adobe XD include website design, mobile app design, and web/desktop app design. The tool allows designers to create designs for an experience (creating a layout, drawing UI elements like buttons, adding colors and other visual effects, etc.) and determine how different user interactions (touch, drag, click, voice interactions, etc.) will change an experience; a process known as prototyping. Designers can also share designs for feedback and review as well as generate materials to provide to developers to turn designs into a working digital experience.
